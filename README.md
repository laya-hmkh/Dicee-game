This is a fun little project that simulates a dice-rolling game. With each page refresh, the system randomly generates two die values, one for "Player 1" and another for "Player 2". The higher total roll wins, and the display declares a winner. It's built using basic web technologies (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) and provides a simple illustration of how to work with random numbers and dynamic content on a website.
